Age of Sosaria — Official Rules

Last updated: v1.0

Age of Sosaria is a long-term, custom Ultima Online shard focused on meaningful progression, fair play, and a healthy community. The following rules exist to protect the shard, its players, and the integrity of gameplay.

Failure to follow these rules may result in warnings, suspensions, or permanent bans.

1. General Conduct

Players are expected to treat others with respect.

Harassment, hate speech, threats, or real-world targeting are not tolerated.

Disagreements and competition are part of the game; personal attacks are not.

Staff reserves the right to take action against behavior that harms the community, even if it is not explicitly listed here.

2. Exploits, Bugs, and Abuse

Exploiting bugs, mechanics, or unintended behavior is prohibited.

Duping, item cloning, or abuse of server systems will result in severe penalties.

Players are encouraged to report bugs to staff.

Claiming ignorance does not exempt a player from punishment.

3. Third-Party Software & Automation

Unauthorized third-party programs, scripts, or automation tools are prohibited.

Macros must comply with server limitations.

AFK gameplay that provides unfair progression or advantages may be penalized.

4. Accounts & Multi-Accounting

Players are allowed up to three (3) accounts.

Use of additional accounts beyond this limit is prohibited.

Circumventing account limits through alternate identities, VPNs, or other methods is not allowed.

All accounts are considered the responsibility of the same player for enforcement purposes.

5. PvP & Player Interaction

PvP is allowed where game rules permit it.

Griefing that serves no gameplay purpose (harassment, corpse blocking, stalling, etc.) may be penalized.

Repeatedly targeting a player for harassment rather than competition is not allowed.

6. Housing & World Resources

Housing placement abuse (blocking key areas or intentionally disrupting gameplay) is prohibited.

Staff may remove houses or items that negatively impact server health or gameplay.

Resource monopolization through exploits or automation is not allowed.

7. Economy & Trading

Real-money trading (RMT) of accounts, gold, or items is prohibited.

Scams that rely on exploits or misleading mechanics may be penalized.

Legitimate player-to-player trading is allowed and encouraged.

8. Account Security & Responsibility

Players are responsible for securing their own accounts.

Account sharing is done at the player’s own risk.

Staff will not reverse losses caused by account sharing, negligence, or compromised accounts.

9. Staff Authority & Enforcement

Staff decisions are final.

Punishments may range from warnings to permanent bans.

Attempts to evade punishment will result in escalated action.

10. Development Disclaimer

Age of Sosaria is under active development.

Mechanics, balance, and systems may change.

Bugs, rollbacks, or wipes may occur if necessary for the health of the shard.

11. Final Rule

Use common sense. If you have to ask whether something is allowed, it probably isn’t.
